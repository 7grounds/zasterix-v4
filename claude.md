# Origo Architecture Rules
- Strictly follow the database-driven agent management via Supabase.
- Priority: Transfer existing logic from GitHub (/admin/agents) before adding features.
- Hierarchy: Predefined meeting hierarchies must be respected (Manager is an agent).
- Style: Minimalist, data-centric, zero 'code-bloat'.
